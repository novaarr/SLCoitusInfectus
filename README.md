# SLCoitusInfectus

## About

This mod allows your character to be infected with either Vampirism or Lycanthropy on sexual contact and since v1.0d even lets you become a Succubus (LE only with PSQ).
Through an MCM menu you can customize it (to an extent).

After you've had sex and every condition was met you'll be infected 5s after the animation or later if there are follow up SexLab animations.
Currently there is support for English and German. If you translate it to any other language, let me know and I'll add it.


## Requirements

- SexLab Framework 
- PapyrusUtil (Usually already installed with the SexLab Framework)


## Compability / Support

#### Moonlight Tales

Currently only works with LE since Moonlight Tales SE seems to be passive and there is no way (known to me) to infect yourself like in the LE version.

#### Player Succubus Quest
- There are no Succubus NPCs which could infect you with this type of "curse" (heh) and because of that there is an additional probability slider in the MCM for PSQ to check against EVERY actor the PC is having a "romantic" time with if he's a Succubus (fake one). Don't forget that and set the slider accordingly.
- LE exclusive, since there is no port for it (mainly because overlays are still not possible)


## Future Plans / Working on

- ~Improving scripts~
- ~Adding more customization~
- ~Import/Export~
- ~Infection type selection (future)~
- NPC infections, and infections only. I won't script NPCs behaivor
- Adding regular STDs
  - In Progress: Lice (Missing: In-game items to lessen severity or cure it completely, animations)



#### Open for requests. This mod should stay simple, keep that in mind.
