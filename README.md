# SLCoitusInfectus

## About

The goal of this mod is for your character to be infected with infections through intercourse. Support for NPCs is also planned, though restricted to sexual encounters with the player.

Currently there is support for English, German and Russian. If you translate it to any other language, let me know and I'll add it.
